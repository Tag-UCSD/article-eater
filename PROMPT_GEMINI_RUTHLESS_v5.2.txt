# RUTHLESS v5.2 — Article Eater GO/NO‑GO (Governance‑First, Multi‑Expert)

**Panel**: Principal Engineer (enterprise stability) · Cognitive Psychology Methods Lead · UX/UI Expert.

**Hard rules**: Do not delete. If a file must be replaced, move the old one under `quarantine/YYYY‑MM‑DD/<path>` and record the rationale in `release.keep.yml: notes`. Respect the kept list and PR checklist.

## Checklist
A) Governance & drift — Constitution, kept list, CI workflow, PR template, CODEOWNERS, governance scripts, ledger, `deconcat.py`, manifest script present and unchanged; no kept‑file deletions.
B) Contracts & ledger — `public_surface_ledger.json` matches code; `contracts/*` present (especially `contracts/rules_v1.md`).
C) Runtime & packaging — `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` pins versions; optional `Dockerfile`. One‑command local run documented.
D) DB & migrations — reversible migrations present and consistent with models; rollback path documented.
E) Tests — unit/integration tests present and run in CI; minimum: governance sanity + meta‑review utilities.
F) UX/UI — empty/loading and error states; tree/flat toggles; provenance counts and negative results visible; basic a11y.
G) Methods validity — micro→meso→macro aggregation logic, effect sizes, sample sizes; negative/no‑effect handling; per‑rule provenance.
H) Release — ZIP + concatenated TXT reconstruct via `deconcat.py`; `MANIFEST.sha256` published.

## Output
- GO/NO‑GO with one‑line rationale from each panelist.
- Blocking / High / Medium issues with paths.
- ≤10‑step patch plan that obeys governance.

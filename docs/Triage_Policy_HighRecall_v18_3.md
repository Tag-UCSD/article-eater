# Triage Policy — High Recall (v18.3) — 2025-11-14
Goal: **recall ≥ 95%** at abstract-only triage. Favor inclusion; minimize false negatives.
- Use abstract/metadata scoring with a low threshold; keep borderline items.
- Provide a *Recall Sampler* report (random 5–10% of discards for manual spot-check).
- UI shows rationale: keep/drop with top terms & similarity evidence.
- Escalation to deeper stages is gated by cluster size, user request, or QC failure.

# governance-kit-v3

governance-kit-v3 is a small, repo-agnostic governance layer for AI-assisted
development. It is meant to be dropped into any project directory, even before
Git is used, to provide:

- a `SYSTEM_VISION.md` that explains why the system exists;
- a `PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md` that lists non-negotiable rules;
- a `CONVERSATION_LEDGER.yml` that records key human–AI sessions;
- a guard script `conversation_guard.py` to sanity-check the governance files.

The repository also includes a concatenated one-file representation
`governance_kit_v3_concatenated.txt` that can be handed to other AI systems.

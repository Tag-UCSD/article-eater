# RUTHLESS v5.1 — Article Eater GO/NO‑GO (Governance‑First)
**Panel:** Enterprise Stability Engineer · Cognitive Psychology Methods Lead · UX/UI Expert
**Hard rules:** No deletions. Quarantine old files. Respect `release.keep.yml` and `deprecations.yml`. Contract‑first.

## Checks
A) Governance present & enforced; no kept-file deletions.
B) Contracts/micro‑contracts; `public_surface_ledger.json` current.
C) Repo health: pinned deps; local run; logging; secrets hygiene.
D) DB & migrations: present, reversible, versioned.
E) Tests & coverage.
F) Frontend: rules tree, provenance, empty/loading, a11y.
G) Paper→rules validity: provenance, evidence counts, negative results.
H) Release assets: ZIP + concatenated TXT + `deconcat.py` + SHA256 manifest.

## Output
- GO/NO‑GO with rationale
- Blocking / High / Medium issues
- Minimal patch plan (≤10 steps) with filenames/path
